# market-microstructure-simulator
This project is a sophisticated, single-page web application that simulates a virtual stock exchange. It provides a dynamic and interactive environment to visualize the core concepts of market microstructure, which is the study of the detailed process of exchanging assets. The simulator demonstrates how orders are placed, matched, and executed, and how these actions collectively impact the market price and liquidity.

Key Features
Real-time Order Book: A live, two-sided order book displays all pending buy orders (bids) and sell orders (asks), sorted by price.

Order Types: Supports both Limit Orders (specifying a fixed price) and Market Orders (executed immediately at the best available price).

Market Impact Simulation: By placing large market orders, users can observe slippage and price impact as their orders consume available liquidity from the order book.

Bid-Ask Spread Visualization: The difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask is visually clear, representing market liquidity.

Price Charting: A live-updating line chart tracks the last traded price, providing a visual history of market movements.

Recent Trades Log: A log of all executed trades, including price, quantity, and time, is displayed in real time.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the foundational structure of the application.

CSS3: For styling and layout, with a custom dark theme built using Tailwind CSS.

JavaScript (ES6): The core logic for the simulator, managing the order book, processing trades, and updating the UI dynamically.

Chart.js: A popular open-source library used to generate the interactive and live-updating price chart.

How to Use
To view and interact with the simulator, simply open the simulator.html file in any modern web browser.
